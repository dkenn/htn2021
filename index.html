                    I dont know yet. It'll probably say something like "this website is made to 
                    inform Canadians on political issues and the vaarious stances that parties take. 
                    Being uninformed is a large problem amongst the new generation of voters in Canada.
                     This website creates and easy way to get informed on all of the leading parties 
                     in preparation for the election on Sunday?"
